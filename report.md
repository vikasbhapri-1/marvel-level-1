## Task 8: Writing resource article using markdown 
AIM - writing the resource article using the markdown. 
- markdown text is an exclusive languange that is used to write a text in a plain and formal manner texts without the usage any text editor and here we can also add the external links ,websites and by just giving the address of the the image or the website and we can provide complete image by using some of the tags.

## TASK 9: Tinkercad
AIM - To get familiar with the application, understand the example circuits given and simulate a simple circuit using an ultrasonic sensor to estimate the distance between an obstacle and the sensor.
- learnt about the radar and about the devices which all required to do the rador and how they helps in the sensing the obstactle and the connection of the rador parts with one another and also got familierised with the usage tinkercad website too.

## TASK 11: LED Toggle Using ESP32
AIM - Learn the working of an ESP32 and create a standalone web server with an ESP32 that controls the LED connected with ESP32 GPIOs and also learn to configure the IDE to upload code to an ESP32
- Here ESP32 is an micro controller with inbuilt wi-fi and bluetooth in it.Along with ESP32 we use Ardunio IDE to upload the code into ESP32 with the help of USB and this ESP32 is connected to the LED's so, as soon as we upload the code into ESP32 it provides the IP adress for toggling of the LED's so we can use this IP adress and can monitor the toggle of the LEd's.

## TASK 12: Soldering Prerequisites
AIM - Learn to use them and perform basic soldering on a perf board.
- All the the circuit board requires the soldering so that we can fit up the required devices in to the perf board and make them to work co-ordinatively. Here we use the soldering device to melt the given iron and fit the LED's into the board and also to remove the soldered LED's.

## TASK 14: Karnaugh Maps and Deriving the logic circuit
AIM - For 4 cases, based on door lock/open and key pressed/not pressed. Determine the karnaugh map and make a burglar alarm using simple logic circuits.
- Here in this task we are going to detect the alaraming case for the lock open and closed with and without key pressed situations and finally derieving the logic gates for that specific condition for which actually the alaramig takes place along with its equation.

## Task 17: Introduction to VR

AIM - Familiarise yourself with what Virtual Reality.

- VR means the virtual reality and the through VR device where we can enter into the VR reality and explore the virtual world and it almost a type of a gamings.
Here in this task i firstly entered into the work club where i am supposed to pick a globe using my virtual hand and that globe hosts me into a new place where there are so many games like archery,shootings and many more. so i went up with an archey whre i picekd up a bow and using that i need shoot to a enemy and the second part of the game is that i need to survive fom those enemies again with using the bow only.
